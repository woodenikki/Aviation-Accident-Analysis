## Business Understanding

> Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

### Stakeholder and key business questions

- What are the most common types of incidents and accidents reported in the dataset?
- What are the most common causes of aviation accidents?
- How does weather condition correlate with accident severity?
- Which aircraft categories are involved in the most accidents?
- Which phase of flight is most prone to accidents?
- Are there any trends in accident occurrence over time?

## Conclusion

The insights gathered from our charts underscore the importance of proactive safety measures, data-driven decision-making, and collaboration across the aviation industry to sustain and enhance safety standards.

1. **Prioritize Pilot Training and Maintenance:** Pilot control issues and maintenance problems are key contributors to incidents. To improve safety, invest in rigorous pilot training, robust maintenance protocols, and continuous monitoring of incident data.

2. **Address Regulatory Factors and Safety Training:** Compliance with regulations like Part 91 and Part 135 is crucial. Enhance safety training, reporting procedures, and regular aircraft checks to ensure compliance and mitigate risks.

3. **Consider Non-Weather Factors in Accidents:** Surprisingly, accidents occur more often in favorable weather (VMC). This highlights the importance of addressing human error and mechanical failures alongside weather conditions.

4. **Tailor Safety Measures to Aircraft Categories:** While airplanes and helicopters record the most accidents, usage rates should be considered. Develop tailored safety measures for different aircraft categories to address specific risks.

5. **Focus Safety Interventions on Critical Flight Phases:** Landing, takeoff, and cruise are high-risk phases. Target safety interventions to improve stability during these critical phases and minimize accident rates.

6. **Celebrate Decreasing Accident Trends:** Encouragingly, accidents are decreasing yearly. This trend reflects ongoing improvements in aviation safety practices, providing optimism for stakeholders.
